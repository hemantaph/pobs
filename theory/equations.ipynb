    "### Posterior Overlap and Hypothesis Testing in Lensed Gravitational Wave Astronomy \n",
    "\n",
    "Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has emerged as a pivotal field in understanding the cosmos, particularly through the observation of events such as compact binary mergers. A major scientific challenge within this domain is distinguishing between lensed and unlensed gravitational wave events. Lensed events occur when a massive body, like a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies, bends the path of the gravitational waves emanating from a distant astronomical event, such as a binary merger, causing multiple detectable signals from what is essentially a single event. Conversely, unlensed events involve signals that reach observers without such interference. This distinction is crucial for accurate cosmological measurements and understanding the distribution of matter in the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite advancements in detection and analysis techniques, there are significant gaps in methodologies used to verify if detected signals are lensed. Previous studies relied on comparing the posterior probability distributions of observed event parameters to determine their lensing probability. However, these analyses often used outdated or oversimplified astrophysical models or no moddels at all, and lacked in mathematical rigor, failing to incorporate complex processes such as reparametrization, Jacobians, or renormalization of the parameter space. Additionally, prior methods such as employing scipy's multi-dimensional gaussian_kde did not adequately capture the necessary parameter correlations, often leading to unreliable probability density functions (PDFs). This was primarily due to the method's approach of fitting multi-dimensional spheres with a constant bandwidth at each parameter point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study addresses these deficiencies by implementing an advanced Bayesian analysis framework that integrates model-dependent astrophysical priors reflecting the latest understanding of both lensed and unlensed events. We also employ sophisticated mathematical techniques including reparametrization, Jacobian transformations, and renormalization to enhance the accuracy of our Bayesian framework. Instead of the traditional gaussian_kde, we utilize sklearn's BayesianGaussianMixture model, which provides a more accurate modeling of parameter correlations and captures the complex differences expected between the parameter distributions of lensed and unlensed events.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing the limitations of previous studies, our research provides a robust tool for interpreting the intricate nature of gravitational wave observations. This refined approach significantly improves the estimation of the odds ratio for the lensing hypothesis and enhances the reliability of the hypothesis testing process.\n",

    "## Initial setup \n",

    "### Odds ratio calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze posterior overlap, consider two gravitational wave (GW) events. The posterior distributions of the parameters for the first and second events are denoted as $P(\\theta_1|d_1)$ and $P(\\theta_2|d_2)$, respectively. To test if these events are images of the same astrophysical source, we evaluate the hypothesis $H_L$ (lensed) against $H_U$ (unlensed). The odds ratio is employed to quantify the evidence supporting the lensed hypothesis. The probability of the hypothesis $H_L$ being correct given the data from the two events is $P(H_L|{d_1,d_2})$, and for $H_U$ it is $P(H_U|{d_1,d_2})$. The odds ratio is defined as:\n",

    "We assume $\\mathcal{P}_U^L = 1$ to maintain neutrality between the lensed and unlensed hypotheses, focusing on the influence of the data via the Bayes factor $\\mathcal{B}_U^L$ in the odds ratio calculation.\n",
